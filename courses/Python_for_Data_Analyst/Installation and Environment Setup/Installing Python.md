#Python: Installation and Environment Setup
#Installing Python

#### Module Overview 
 In this module on Installation and Environment Setup, we'll discuss Installing Python. 

Learning Objectives: 

-  Learn about different ways of downloading and installing python 
-  Learn how to setup and install python in your operating system 
-  Learn about different ways of running python in your operating system 


##### Installation 

Python can be downloaded from http://www.python.org/. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. There are two versions of Python - Python 2 and Python 3 The current version of Python is Python 3. Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2, and Python 2 will not be supported after 2020. In this course, we will use Python 3. 

##### Installation - Windows 

The file you will download from the Python website is in the form of an executable installer. 

You can run the installer by double clicking on the executable file. 

The installer will guide you through the installation process. 

For the installation to be successful, you will need to have administrative privileges on the machine on which you are installing Python. 

The installation process will ask you if you want to install Anaconda. Anaconda is a third party distribution of Python which includes a large number of additional libraries and tools. 

Anaconda also includes a Python IDE called Spyder which is useful for writing and debugging Python programs. 

For this course, we will not use Anaconda. If you want to use Anaconda, you can select it during the installation process. 

The Python installation process will also ask you if you want to install pip. pip is a command line tool used to install additional libraries and tools. 

If you do not have pip, you can install it by following the instructions here. 

Once you have installed Python, you can use the Windows command prompt to run Python programs. 

##### Installation  - Mac 


The file you will download from the Python website is in the form of a disk image (.dmg file). 

Once you have downloaded the file, open it and double click on the Python.mpkg file. 

The Python installation process will ask you if you want to install pip. pip is a command line tool used to install additional libraries and tools. 

If you do not have pip, you can install it by following the instructions here. 

Once you have installed Python, you can use the Terminal application to run Python programs. 

##### Installation  - Linux 


In Linux, you can use the package manager to install Python. 

For example, to install Python in Ubuntu, you can use the command: 

sudo apt-get install Python3 

Once you have installed Python, you can use the command line to run Python programs. 

##### Setting up and installing python in your operating system 


On Windows, Python is usually installed in the C:\Python33 directory. 

When this is the case, you will find a Python.exe file in that location. 

In order to run a Python program, you can double click on the Python.exe file. 

This will open the Python shell. 

The Python shell is a command line interface where you can type Python commands. 

The shell will execute the Python commands as soon as you press the Enter key. 

In order to exit the Python shell, you can type quit() and press Enter. 

On Mac and Linux, the Python installation process will not add Python to the system path. 

In order to run a Python program, you will have to specify the full path to the Python.exe file. 

In order to use the Terminal application in Mac, you will have to open the Finder window and navigate to the Applications folder. 

Once you are in the Applications folder, you can double click on the Terminal application to open it. 

In Linux, you will have to open the Terminal application from the system menu. 

Once you have opened the Terminal application, you can use the cd command to change the current directory. 

In Windows,
