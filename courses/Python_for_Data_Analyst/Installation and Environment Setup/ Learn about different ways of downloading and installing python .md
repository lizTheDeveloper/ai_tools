If you want to get started programming in Python, you're going to need to have access to the Python interpreter. In this article, we'll show you a few different ways to get the Python interpreter on your system. 

 

1.  Using the Anaconda Distribution 

The Anaconda distribution is a free, easy-to-install bundle of the Python interpreter and a bunch of other useful tools and libraries for data science. If you're just getting started with Python and data science, we recommend installing the Anaconda distribution. 

You can download the Anaconda installer for macOS from the Anaconda Downloads page. Once the installer has been downloaded, double-click on it to run it. 

You'll be presented with a series of prompts. Read each one carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking before proceeding. Generally, you can just hit the Enter key to accept the default value for each prompt. 

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that it was successful by opening a new terminal window and typing the command python --version . This should print out the version number of the Python interpreter that was installed. 

 

2.  Using Homebrew 

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. It makes it easy to install all sorts of software on your computer, including the Python interpreter. 

Before you can install Python using Homebrew, you'll need to install Homebrew on your system. You can do this by opening a new terminal window and typing the command ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" . This will download and run a script that will install Homebrew on your system. 

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Python by typing the command brew install python3 in a new terminal window. This will install the latest stable release of Python 3. 

You can verify that Python was installed correctly by typing the command python3 --version . This should print out the version number of the Python interpreter that was installed. 

 

3.  Using MacPorts 

MacPorts is another package manager for macOS. It makes it easy to install all sorts of software on your computer, including the Python interpreter. 

Before you can install Python using MacPorts, you'll need to install MacPorts on your system. You can do this by downloading the MacPorts installer from the MacPorts Downloads page. Once the installer has been downloaded, double-click on it to run it. 

You'll be presented with a series of prompts. Read each one carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking before proceeding. Generally, you can just hit the Enter key to accept the default value for each prompt. 

Once the installation is complete, you can install Python by typing the command sudo port install python36 in a new terminal window. This will install the latest stable release of Python 3. 

You can verify that Python was installed correctly by typing the command python3.6 --version . This should print out the version number of the Python interpreter that was installed. 

 

4.  Using Source 

If you want to install the latest development release of Python, you can do so by downloading the source code from the Python Downloads page and compiling it yourself. 

This is generally not recommended for users who are not experienced with compiling software from source code, as it can be difficult to get everything set up correctly. If you want to try this method, we recommend following the instructions in the official Python documentation.

#The code you write must be valid Python code.
#Your code should be well-formatted and readable to another programmer.
#You may choose to use comments in your code.
#You may optionally include a short paragraph summarizing your example and explaining the code. 
#You may also choose to include comments in your code to explain what is happening.

#Import the pandas library
import pandas as pd 

#Read the csv file into a DataFrame using the read_csv function from pandas
col_df = pd.read_csv("Cost_of_Living_Index.csv")
print(col_df)
print("\n" * 2) #Print two blank lines between each print statement for better readability

#Calculate the mean for each city using the mean() function from pandas and store it in a variable called 'mean'
mean = col_df.mean() 
print(mean)
print("\n" * 2)

#Calculate the maximum cost of living in each city using the max() function from pandas and store it in a variable called 'max'
max = col_df.max() 
print(max)
