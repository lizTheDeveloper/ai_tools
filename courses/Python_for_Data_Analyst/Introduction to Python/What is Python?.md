#### What is Python?

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

#### What is an interpreted language?

An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code).

#### What are the benefits of Python?

Python is a very popular programming language. It has many benefits including: 

-  It is easy to learn and use
-  It is open source
-  It has a large standard library
-  It is portable
-  It is interpreted
-  It is object-oriented
