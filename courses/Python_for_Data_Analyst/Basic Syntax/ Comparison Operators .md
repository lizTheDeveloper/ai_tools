#  Comparison Operators 
        
-   == (Equal to)
-   != (Not equal to)
-   > (Greater than)
-   < (Less than)
-   >= (Greater than or equal to)
-   <= (Less than or equal to)



## Python Comparison Operators 

Python supports the following comparison operators :

-   == (Equal to)
-   != (Not equal to)
-   > (Greater than)
-   < (Less than)
-   >= (Greater than or equal to)
-   <= (Less than or equal to)

Python comparison operators are also called **Relational Operators**.

Python supports all the standard comparison operator types from other programming languages like C,C++,Java etc.

In addition to these Python supports the following comparison operators:

-   `is`
-   `is not`

The **`is`** and **`is not`** operators are used to determine whether two variables are the same object.

If two variables are the same object, then the `is` operator will return the value True.

If the two variables are not the same object, then the `is` operator will return the value False.

The **`is not`** operator is the negation of the `is` operator.

It will return the value True if the two variables are not the same object, and it will return the value False if the two variables are the same object.

## Python Equal To Operator

Equal to Operator (==)

The equal to operator (==) is used to compare two values.

It will return the value True if the values are equal, and it will return the value False if the values are not equal.

The equal to operator is also called the **comparison operator** because it can be used to compare two values.

**Example**

The following code shows how to use the equal to operator in a Python program.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

x = 10
y = 20

# prints False
print(x == y)

# prints True
print(x == 10)
```

In the above example, the variable `x` is assigned the value 10 and the variable `y` is assigned the value 20.

The equal to operator (==) is used to compare the value of `x` to the value of `y`.

The equal to operator will return the value False if `x` is not equal to `y`.

The equal to operator will return the value True if `x` is equal to `y`.

The equal to operator is also used to compare the value of `x` to the value 10.

The equal to operator will return the value True if `x` is equal to 10.

The equal to operator is a **binary operator** because it takes two operands.

## Python Not Equal To Operator

Not Equal To Operator (!=)

The not equal to operator (!=) is used to compare two values.

It will return the value True if the values are not equal, and it will return the value False if the values are equal.

The not equal to operator is the negation of the equal to operator.

It will return the value True if the values are not equal, and it will return the value False if the values are equal.

**Example**

The following code shows how to use the not equal to operator in a Python program.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

x = 10
y = 20

# prints True
print(x != y)

# prints False
print(x != 10)
```

In the above example, the variable `x` is assigned the value 10 and the variable `y` is assigned the value 20.

The not equal to operator (!=) is used to compare the value of `x` to the value of `y`.

The not equal to operator will return the value True if `x` is not equal to `y`.

The not equal to operator will return the value False if `x` is equal to `y`.

The not equal to operator is also used to compare the value of `x` to the value 10.

The not equal to operator will return the value False if `x` is equal to 10.

The not equal to operator is a **binary operator** because it takes two operands.

        ### When might you need to  Comparison Operators ?
        
1. You might need to use comparison operators when you are cleaning data and want to find all of the rows that contain invalid data.
2. You might need to use comparison operators when you are performing statistical analysis and want to compare two groups of data.
3. You might need to use comparison operators when you are creating visualizations and want to highlight certain data points.

        This might look like:

        1. Compare the average age of two different groups of people.
2. Find all of the rows in a dataset that contain invalid data.
3. Highlight the data points in a visualization that represent the most extreme values.

        ### How do you practice  Comparison Operators ?
        

Complete the following exercise to practice comparison operators in Python:

Given the following list of numbers, assign the correct boolean value to the variable name corresponding to each comparison:

a) 4 == 4   True

b) 4 == 3  False

c) 4 > 3  True

d) 4 < 3 False

e) 4 >= 3 True

f) 4 <= 3 False
