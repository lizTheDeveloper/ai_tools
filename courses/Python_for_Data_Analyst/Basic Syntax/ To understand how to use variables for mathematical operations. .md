# Assigning values to variables 
 
Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.

# Assigning operators to variables 

You can assign an arithmetic operator to a variable.

# Performing calculations with variables 

When you perform calculations with variables, the Python interpreter follows the mathematical order of operations.

# Converting between types 

Sometimes you will need to convert a value from one type to another. For example, you may need to convert an integer to a floating-point number so that you can perform division in your calculations. You can convert a value from one type to another with the int(), float(), and str() methods.
    ### When might you need to  To understand how to use variables for mathematical operations. ?
    

1. You need to calculate the average price of a product over the past year.
2. You need to find the total number of products sold in a given month.
3. You need to calculate the commission earned by a salesperson in a given month.

    This might look like:

     1. Average price of a product over the past year: You might need to calculate this if you are trying to determine whether the price of a product is increasing or decreasing over time.
2. Total number of products sold in a given month: This information could be useful for inventory purposes or for sales projections.
3. Commission earned by a salesperson in a given month: This information could be used to calculate sales commissions or for sales incentive programs.

    ### How do you practice  To understand how to use variables for mathematical operations. ?
    

x = 5 
y = 3 

print(x+y) 
print(x*y) 
print(x/y) 
print(x-y)

# We can find the median number of hours worked by employees by using the median() function

median_hours_worked = median(hours_worked)

# We can find the number of employees by using the len() function

number_of_employees = len(hours_worked)

# We can find the minimum number of hours worked by employees by using the min() function

minimum_hours_worked = min(hours_worked)

# We can find the maximum number of hours worked by employees by using the max() function

maximum_hours_worked = max(hours_worked)

 
# A Data Analyst would use the following code to understand how to use list variables in a course on Python

# Let's say we have data on the number of hours worked by employees at a company broken down by department
# The first list is for Finance, the second list is for Marketing, and the third list is for HR

finance = [40, 39, 37, 36, 35] # Finance hours worked
marketing = [33, 32, 30, 29] # Marketing hours worked
hr = [29] # HR hours worked

 
# A Data Analyst would use the following code to understand how to use mathematical operators in a course on Python
# Let's say we have data on the number of hours worked by employees at a company broken down by department and we want to add an hour to each employee's timecard. We could do this with the following addition operator code:


finance = [40 + 1, 39 + 1, 37 + 1, 36 + 1, 35 + 1] # Finance hours worked including overtime hours added in
marketing = [33 + 1, 32 + 1, 30 + 1, 29 + 1] # Marketing hours worked including overtime hours added in 
hr = [29 + 1] # HR hours worked including overtime hours added in

 
# A Data Analyst would use the following code to understand how to use mathematical operators in a course on Python. Let's say we have data on the number of hours worked by employees at a company broken down by department and we want to multiply each employee's timecard by two. We could do this with the following multiplication operator code:


finance = [40 * 2, 39 * 2, 37 * 2, 36 * 2, 35 * 2] # Finance hours worked including overtime hours multiplied in 
marketing = [33 * 2, 32 * 2, 30 * 2, 29 * 2] # Marketing hours worked including overtime hours multiplied in 
hr = [29 * 2] # HR hours worked including overtime hours multiplied in

 
# A Data Analyst would use the following code to understand how to use mathematical operators in a course on Python. Let's say we have data on the number of hours worked by employees at a company broken down by department and we want to divide each employee's timecard by two. We could do this with the following division operator code:


finance = [40 / 2, 39 / 2, 37 / 2, 36 / 2, 35 / 2] # Finance hours worked divided in half 
marketing = [33 / 2, 32 / 2, 30 / 2, 29 / 2] # Marketing hours worked divided in half 
hr = [29 / 2] # HR hours worked divided in half
