#Basic operators

#### Module Overview 
 In this module on Basic operators, we'll discuss Basic operators.

-  Logical Operators 

-  Bitwise Operators 

-  Membership Operators 

-  Identity Operators 

-  Operator Precedence 


##### Assignment Operators 

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

a = 5 

a += 3 # a = a + 3 

print(a) 

##### Comparison Operators 

Comparison operators are used to compare values. It returns either True or False according to the condition. 

> Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right 

< Less than - True if left operand is less than the right 

== Equal to - True if both operands are equal 

!= Not equal to - True if operands are not equal 

>= Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right 

<= Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right 

## Logical Operators 
Logical operators are the and, or, not operators. 

and 

True if both the operands are true 

or 

True if either of the operands is true 

not 

True if operand is false (complements the operand) 

## Bitwise Operators 
Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were string of binary digits. It operates bit by bit, hence the name. 

& 

Bitwise AND 

| 

Bitwise OR 

~ 

Bitwise NOT 

^ 

Bitwise XOR 

>> 

Bitwise right shift 

<< 

Bitwise left shift 

## Membership Operators 
Membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples. 

in 

True if value is found in the sequence 

not in 

True if value is not found in the sequence 

## Identity Operators 
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects. 

is 

True if the operands are identical (refer to the same object) 

is not 

True if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object) 

## Operator Precedence 
Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator: 

2 + 3 * 4 

is equal to 14, not 20 because multiplication is performed before addition. 

Here, + and * have the same precedence, so how is the expression evaluated? Python evaluates an expression from left to right. So 2 + 3 is evaluated first to give 5. Then, 5 * 4 is evaluated next to give 20. 

If operators with the same precedence are used, a rule must be defined for their evaluation order. Python strictly evaluates expressions from left to right. 

You can control the order of evaluation of an expression by using parentheses. For example: 

(1+3) * (2+3) 

is evaluated as 

(1+3) * 5 

16 

If you want to evaluate an expression in a specific order, simply use parentheses to override the default precedence.
