 ## Install NumPy 
 
 
 In order to work with NumPy, you will need to install it. The best way to do that is to use one of the major package managers, such as conda or pip.
 
 ### Install NumPy with pip

pip is a package manager for installing and managing Python packages.

To install NumPy with pip, type the following:

``
pip install numpy
``
 

 ### Install NumPy with conda
 
 
Conda is a package manager for installing and managing Python packages.

To install NumPy with conda, type the following:

``
conda install numpy
``

## NumPy arrays



### Creating NumPy arrays

There are a number of ways to create NumPy arrays. The simplest way is to create them from lists, using the `array` function:

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```



### NumPy array attributes

NumPy arrays have a number of useful attributes, such as `ndim`, `shape`, and `size`.



### NumPy array indexing and slicing

Indexing and slicing NumPy arrays is similar to indexing and slicing lists in Python, with a few important differences.



### NumPy array operations

NumPy arrays support element-wise operations, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.



## NumPy random numbers

The `random` module in NumPy provides functions for generating random numbers.



## NumPy linear algebra

The `linalg` module in NumPy provides functions for linear algebra, such as matrix multiplication, matrix inverse, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
